# Multi Graph

This is an example of showing a graph contains parallel edges between nodes.
The node representation can be composed by several sub-layers.
The edges will route to the nodes accordingly by the number of the edges between two nodes.
If there's only one edge, it will be a straight line; otherwise the edge will be drawn as a curved line.
